#Use Blocks </H1>

*Blocks* are used to create workflows in PROOF. Each *Block* represents a specific functionality or model that can be executed within a workflow.

The *Block* is defined by its *Template*, which specifies the inputs, outputs, and execution logic of the block. 

There are several predefined *Block Templates* available in PROOF that can be used to create workflows.

To use a *Block* in a workflow, you only need to select a *Block* from the available *Templates* list in the right sidebar of the *PROOF Workflow Editor* and drag and drop it onto the Workflow canvas.

After having positioned the *Block* on the canvas, you can connect its inputs and outputs to other *Blocks* in the workflow to define the data flow between them.

When selecting a *Block* on the canvas, you can see and configure some of its settings, e.g. the *Block's* visible name or color, in the *Block Configuration* panel that appears on the *PROOF Workflow Editor*.

If the *Workflow* is complete, you can save it and execute it using the *START WORKFLOW* button in the right upper corner of the *PROOF Workflow Editor*.
Alternatively, you can also start a saved *Workflow* from the *Monitoring* panel in the PROOF UI (2nd menu in the left sidebar).

#Use own Blocks

It is also possible to create your own *Blocks* by defining new *Templates* in PROOF. For this, see [Creating new Block Templates](creating-new-templates.md).
