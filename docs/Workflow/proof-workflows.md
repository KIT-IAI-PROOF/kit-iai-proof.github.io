# PROOF *Workflow* Structure
A workflow consists of a combination of workflow elements that must be conducted in a particular order and implemented 
using several software tools.
A *PROOF Workflow* defines how blocks are coupled and which outputs and inputs are connected to allow data transfer.
It follows a given structure that defines how blocks are connected and executed.
